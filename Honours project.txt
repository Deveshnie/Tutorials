The goal of this project is to investigate theories of dark energy and the cosmological constant.

The project consists of two parts:

(1) a survey of the literature to understand some of the competing theories to explain the accelerated expansion of the
 universe and the underlying physics, and

(2) integrating numerically the ordinary differential equation for the expansion of the universe to obtain theoretical
 predictions for various observables and constructing a likelihood for BAO and supernova data, so that the theories can be 
 constrained by observational data.
 
 I would like to learn how to perform numerical integration and how to plot graphs in python.
